# Part 1. USArrests Dataset and Hierarchical Clustering

Consider the "USArrests" data. It is a built-in dataset you may directly
get in RStudio. Perform hierarchical clustering on the observations
(states) and answer the following questions.

```{r}
head(USArrests)
```

Using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and Euclidean
distance, cluster the states.

```{r}
set.seed(2)
data("USArrests")
data <- USArrests
data <- na.omit(data)
d_matrix <- dist(data, method = "euclidean")

hc <- hclust(d_matrix)
plot(hc, main="Complete Linkage", cex = .8)

```

Cut the dendrogram at a height that results in three distinct clusters.
Interpret the clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?

States like California, New York, Florida, and Illinois are included in
Cluster 1 because they have greater rates of violent crimes and arrests.
States like Arkansas, Georgia, and Tennessee, which have modest rates of
violent crimes and arrests, are included in Cluster 2. Finally, Cluster
3 includes states like Maine, Montana, and Vermont that have lower rates
of violent crime and arrests.

```{r}
clust <- cutree(hc, 3)
clust

```

```{r}
table (clust)
subset(row.names(USArrests), clust == 1)
subset(row.names(USArrests), clust == 2)
subset(row.names(USArrests), clust == 3)

```

Hierarchically cluster the states using complete linkage and Euclidean
distance, after scaling the variables to have standard deviation one.
Obtain three clusters. Which states belong to which clusters?

Based on their similarities and differences, the 50 states in the
USArrests dataset were grouped into three clusters via the cutree()
algorithm. Eight Southeastern states, including Alabama and Louisiana,
are grouped together in the first cluster because they all have high
rates of violent crime across the dataset's four categories. The second
cluster consists of 11 states, including Arizona, California, and Texas,
with intermediate levels of violent crime and murder, rape, and assault
arrest rates. The remaining 32 states that have relatively lower rates
of violent crimes and homicide, rape, and assault arrest rates make up
the third cluster. As a result, the USArrests dataset's clustering
exposes varied patterns of criminal behavior across several states.

```{r}
set.seed(2)
data("USArrests")
data <- USArrests
data <- na.omit(data)
data_scale <- scale(data)
d_matrix <- dist(data_scale, method = "euclidean")

hc_scaled <- hclust(d_matrix)
plot(hc_scaled, main="Complete Linkage", cex = .8)
```

```{r}

ggdendrogram(hc_scaled, segments = TRUE, lables = TRUE, leaf_labels = TRUE, rotate = FALSE, theme_dendro = TRUE ) + labs(title = "Linkage")

```

```{r}

```

What effect does scaling the variables have on the hierarchical
clustering obtained? In your opinion, should the variables be scaled
before the inter-observation dissimilarities are computed?

*Prior to executing hierarchical clustering, scaling variables can have
a substantial impact on the clusters that are produced. If variables are
not scaled, the distance calculation may favor the variables with higher
variances over the rest, clustering data predominantly based on those
variables. To ensure that each variable contributes equally to the
distance calculation and prevent dominance by a single variable,
variables can be scaled to have equal variances, for example by
standardizing with a standard deviation of one.*

*Scaling variables can result in more precise and meaningful grouping,
hence in my opinion it should be done before estimating
inter-observation dissimilarities. By eliminating unit discrepancies
between variables, scaling can also improve the meaning of comparisons
between variables.*

# Part 2. Market Segmentation

An advertisement division of large club store needs to perform customer
analysis the store customers in order to create a segmentation for more
targeted marketing campaign

You task is to identify similar customers and characterize them (at
least some of them). In other word perform clustering and identify
customers segmentation.

This data-set is derived from
<https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis>

Assume that data was current on 2014-07-01

Read Dataset and Data Conversion to Proper Data Format

Read "m_marketing_campaign.csv" using `data.table::fread` command,
examine the data.

```{r}
# fread m_marketing_campaign.csv and save it as df 

marketing_data <- fread("m_marketing_campaign.csv")

marketing_data
```

```{r}
# Convert Year_Birth to Age (assume that current date is 2014-07-01)
marketing_data$Age <- 2014 - marketing_data$Year_Birth
  
  
# Dt_Customer is a date (it is still character), convert it to membership days (i.e. number of days person is a member, name it MembershipDays)
# hint: note European date format, use as.Date with proper format argument (2 points)

# marketing_data$Dt_Customer <- as.Date(marketing_data$Dt_Customer, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
# marketing_data$MembershipDays <- as.Date("2014-07-01") - marketing_data$Dt_Customer
# marketing_data$MembershipDays <- as.numeric(marketing_data$MembershipDays, units = "days")

marketing_data[, MembershipDays := as.Date("2014-07-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d") - as.Date(Dt_Customer, format="%d-%m-%Y")]
marketing_data$MembershipDays <- as.numeric(marketing_data$MembershipDays)

marketing_data
```

```{r}
# # Summarize Education column (use table function)  
# 
# 
# # Lets treat Education column as ordinal categories and use simple levels for distance calculations
# # Assuming following order of degrees:
# #    HighSchool, Associate, Bachelor, Master, PhD
# # factorize Education column (hint: use factor function with above levels)

table(marketing_data$Education)

# Factorize Education column
education_levels <- c("HighSchool", "Associate", "Bachelor", "Master", "PhD")
# education_levels
marketing_data$Education <- factor(marketing_data$Education, levels = education_levels)
marketing_data

```

```{r}
# Summarize Marital_Status column (use table function) 

table(marketing_data$Marital_Status)

# Lets convert single Marital_Status categories for 5 separate binary categories  (2 points)
# Divorced, Married, Single, Together and Widow, the value will be 1 if customer 
# is in that category and 0 if customer is not
# hint: use dummyVars from caret package, model.matrix or simple comparison (there are only 5 groups)

marketing_data$Divorced <- ifelse(marketing_data$Marital_Status == "Divorced", 1, 0)
marketing_data$Married <- ifelse(marketing_data$Marital_Status == "Married", 1, 0)
marketing_data$Single <- ifelse(marketing_data$Marital_Status == "Single", 1, 0)
marketing_data$Together <- ifelse(marketing_data$Marital_Status == "Together", 1, 0)
marketing_data$Widow <- ifelse(marketing_data$Marital_Status == "Widow", 1, 0)

head(marketing_data)


```

```{r}
# lets remove columns which we will no longer use:
# remove ID, Year_Birth, Dt_Customer, Marital_Status
# and save it as df_sel 

df_sel <- subset(marketing_data, select = -c(ID, Year_Birth, Dt_Customer, Marital_Status))

# Convert Education to integers 
# hint: use as.integer function, if you use factor function earlier 
# properly then HighSchool will be 1, Associate will be 2 and so on)
df_sel$Education <- as.integer(df_sel$Education)
df_sel
```

```{r}
# lets scale (2 points)
# run scale function on df_sel and save it as df_scale
# that will be our scaled values which we will use for analysis
# convert factor columns to numeric

df_scale <- scale(df_sel)
# df_scale

```

## PCA

Run PCA

```{r}
# Run PCA on df_scale, make biplot and scree plot/percentage variance explained plot
# save as pc_out, we will use pc_out$x[,1] and pc_out$x[,2] later for plotting
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)

pc_out <- PCA(df_scale, graph = FALSE)

# Create biplot
fviz_pca_biplot(pc_out, col.var = "contrib", col.ind = "cos2", geom = "point",
                select.var = list(contrib = 100), axes = c(1,2))

# Create scree plot
fviz_eig(pc_out, addlabels = TRUE)



pca <- prcomp(df_scale, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# create biplot
biplot(pca, choices = c(1, 2))


```

```{r}

```

## Cluster with K-Means 

### Selecting Number of Clusters

Select optimal number of clusters using elbow method.

```{r}

km_out_list <- lapply(1:10, function(k) list(
  k=k,
  km_out=kmeans(df_scale, k, nstart = 20)))

km_results <- data.frame(
  k=sapply(km_out_list, function(k) k$k),
  totss=sapply(km_out_list, function(k) k$km_out$totss),
  tot_withinss=sapply(km_out_list, function(k) k$km_out$tot.withinss)
  )
```

```{r}
set.seed(1)
fviz_nbclust(df_scale, kmeans, method = "wss",k.max=10, nstart=20, iter.max=20) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, linetype = 2)+
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method")


```

Select optimal number of clusters using Gap Statistic.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
gap_kmeans <- clusGap(df_scale, kmeans, nstart = 20, K.max = 10, B = 100, iter.max= 20)
plot(gap_kmeans, main = "Gap Statistic:kmeans")
```

Select optimal number of clusters using Silhouette method.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
par(mar = c(5, 2, 4, 2), mfrow=c(2,2))
for(k in c(2,3,4,9)) {
  kmeans_cluster <- kmeans(df_scale, k, nstart=20)
  si <- silhouette(kmeans_cluster$cluster, dist = dist(df_scale))
  plot(si,main="")
}
par(mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1), mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Number of k = 2 and we can select k = 3 for elbow, gap statistics and
silhuettes as well as clustering

## Clusters Visulalization

Make k-Means clusters with selected k_kmeans (store result as km_out).
Plot your k_kmeans clusters on biplot (just PC1 vs PC2) by coloring
points by their cluster id.

```{r}
set.seed(4)
Km_out <- kmeans(df_scale, 3, nstart = 25)
Km_out

```

```{r}
set.seed(6)
fviz_cluster(Km_out, data = df_scale, ellipse.type = 'euclid', ggtheme = theme_minimal() )
```

```{r}
set.seed(19)
Km_out$cluster <- as.factor(Km_out$cluster)
df_kmeans <- cbind(df_sel, cluster = Km_out$cluster)
```

*there are 3 groups.* The k-means algorithm identified three clusters on
the plot. The red cluster is high spenders who make frequent purchases,
the green cluster is low spenders who make infrequent purchases, and the
blue cluster is high spenders who make purchases less frequently

## Characterizing Cluster

Perform descriptive statistics analysis on obtained cluster. Based on
that does one or more group have a distinct characteristics? Hint: add
cluster column to original df dataframe

```{r}
set.seed(14)
Km_out$cluster <- as.factor(Km_out$cluster)
df_kmeans <- cbind(df_sel, cluster= Km_out$cluster)

agg_kmeans <- aggregate(df_kmeans[,1:20], by= list(df_kmeans$cluster), mean) %>% as.data.frame()

agg_kmeans
```

```{r}

```

## Cluster with Hierarchical Clustering

Perform clustering with Hierarchical method (Do you need to use scaling
here?). Try complete, single and average linkage. Plot dendagram, based
on it choose linkage and number of clusters, if possible, explain your
choice.

I believe that scaling is necessary. Dendrograms show that the complete
linkage method produces the most distinct clusters, while the single
linkage method produces the fewest. Clusters with average linkage are
located in the middle. The full and average linkage methods both show a
subtle elbow around three clusters, but the single linkage
methodÂ doesÂ not.

```{r}
set.seed(23)
dist_matrix <- dist(df_scale, method = "euclidean")
hie_comp <- hclust(dist_matrix, method = "complete")
hc <- as.dendrogram(hie_comp)

plot(hc, main = "Linkage and euclidean", cex = .9)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```
